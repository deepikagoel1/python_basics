Create and Import modules in Python

In Python, a module is a self-contained Python file that contains Python statements and definitions, like a file named GFG.py, can be considered as a module named GFG which can be imported with the help of import statement. However, one might get confused about the difference between modules and packages. A package is a collection of modules in directories that give structure and hierarchy to the modules.

Advantages of modules â€“
Reusability: Working with modules makes the code reusability a reality.
Simplicity: Module focuses on a small proportion of the problem, rather than focusing on the entire problem.
Scoping: A separate namespace is defined by a module that helps to avoid collisions between identifiers.

Creating and Importing a module
A module is simply a Python file with a .py extension that can be imported inside another Python program. The name of the Python file becomes the module name. The module contains definitions and implementation of classes, variables, and functions that can be used inside another program.
